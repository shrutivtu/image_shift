# MNIST Image Shifter

This Streamlit app allows users to upload an MNIST image and shift it in any direction (up, down, left, or right) by one pixel. The app provides the original image and displays all shifted versions of the image.

## Features

- Upload MNIST images (PNG, JPG, or JPEG).
- Select the direction (up, down, left, or right) to shift the image.
- Visualize the shifted image and the original image.
- Optionally, display all shifted versions of the image.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- `streamlit`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `scipy`

You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install streamlit numpy matplotlib scipy
```

## Project Structure

- `app.py`: The main Streamlit app that contains the logic for uploading, shifting, and displaying images.

## How to Run

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.

3. Run the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

4. The app will open in your browser where you can upload an MNIST image, select the shift direction, and view the results.

## Code Overview

### `shift_image(image, direction)`
This function shifts the input MNIST image by one pixel in the specified direction. It uses the `scipy.ndimage.shift` function to perform the shift and ensures the background remains black (0 value).

- **Input**: 
  - `image`: The MNIST image to be shifted.
  - `direction`: The direction to shift the image (`"up"`, `"down"`, `"left"`, `"right"`).
  
- **Output**: The shifted image.

### Streamlit User Interface
The app includes the following functionality:
- Upload an image file.
- Display the original image.
- Allow the user to select a direction to shift the image.
- Display the shifted image and all shifted versions.

### Example Workflow
1. Upload an image.
2. Select a shift direction (up, down, left, or right).
3. View the shifted version of the image.
4. Optionally, view all shifted versions (up, down, left, right).
